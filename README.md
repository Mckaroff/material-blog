# Blogging with Material for MkDocs

Based on a popular theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) satic site generator, 
I added new layout and customized some style to show pages in blogging theme.

I wrote [simplify-theme](https://github.com/vuquangtrong/simplify-theme) when I used [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) to generate my blog site, 
but recently, I found MkDocs is a bit better in making documentation style and searching data.

Please visit my blog at [vuquangtrong.github.io](https://vuquangtrong.github.io) to see this theme in live.
