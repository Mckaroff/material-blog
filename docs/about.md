Hi, 

My name is Vũ Quang Trọng,

[Code Inside Out](https://www.codeinsideout.com/) is my personal blog in which I take notes about what I've learned, and what I'm interested in.

I am working in Embedded Automotive field, mainly focusing on In Vehicle Infortainment (IVI) and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). I also do some personal projects for my sweet home, and some others as my freelance jobs.

I cannot remember all of them in details, so I need somewhere to write down, I also need them searchable to quicky jump to what I want. That's the reason for me to start blogging. Hope you can find something helpful here too.

Let's code ^^
